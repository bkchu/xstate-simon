# XState - Simon

This project was used as a means to learn [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/).  The entire presentation layer was able to fit within the main [App.js](/src/App.tsx)\*. This is due to the fact that all business logic was [handled](/src/machines/simon.ts) by XState.

*\*Yes, definitely not React-y, but this was done intentionally for the sake of demonstrating XState and not my understanding of React*
